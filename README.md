# environment-analysis
In this project, I worked on data processing, visualization, and insights generation using Python and Excel, exploring key environmental factors like elevation, temperature, forest cover, and more. This experience strengthened my skills in data handling, visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib), and Excel automation.
